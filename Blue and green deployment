Blue-Green deployment is a deployment strategy that helps to reduce downtime and risk during a release process. The idea is to have two identical environments, one serving as the production environment (blue), and the other as the staging environment (green). The new version of the application is first deployed to the staging environment, which is thoroughly tested before switching traffic to the new environment.
In this YAML file, we are creating a Kubernetes deployment object for the blue environment. The deployment will run three replicas of the application, each labeled with app: myapp and env: blue. The container specification includes the application image, which is myapp:v1, and the port number 80.
In this YAML file, we are creating a Kubernetes deployment object for the green environment. The deployment will run three replicas of the application, each labeled with app: myapp and env: green. The container specification includes the application image, which is myapp:v2, and the port number 80.

Note that the only difference between the two YAML files is the name of the deployment (myapp-blue vs. myapp-green) and the version of the application image (myapp:v1 vs. myapp:v2).
